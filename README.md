# 🔐 Secure File Storage System with AES

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **secure file storage application** built with **AES-256 encryption** using Python’s `cryptography` library.  
It provides a simple **GUI with PyQt5** to allow users to **encrypt and decrypt files** securely with password-based key derivation.  

## ✨ Features
- AES-256 encryption & decryption using password-derived keys  
- SHA-256 hashing for integrity verification  
- Metadata storage (filename, timestamp, hash) inside encrypted file  
- User-friendly **GUI built with PyQt5**  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3.x**  
- **Libraries:** PyQt5, cryptography
